the goal of this system is to control the pitch of the aircraft given its deflection angle. the transfer function is derived from the aircraft's longitudional equations of motion. the control system is developed using four methods: pid, compensator-rootlocus, compensator-bode and lqr. and finally the entire system is digitized so that it can run on a digital computer.
